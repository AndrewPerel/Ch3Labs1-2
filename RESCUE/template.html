      <p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
      and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>

      <p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We
      also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back
      into their natural environment.</p>

      <p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care
      for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a
      sponsor. Contact us today.</p>
